## Preface

This document is **largely** taken from/inspired by John A. De Goes. More specifically, the articles, ["ZIO Professionalism"](https://degoes.net/articles/zio-professionalism), ["Big Tent"](https://degoes.net/articles/big-tent), and ["Travis Brown, Abuser"](https://degoes.net/articles/travis-brown-abuser). Without his insight, this guideline would not be where it is today.

## Motivation

OpenMEV supports the right of every OSS engineer/developer to contribute on their terms, whatever those terms may be. Non-paying users of free software should not get to dictate these terms. Moreover, OpenMEV's stated objective of being a credible neutral org means that we must formalize a Contributing Guideline so that as it expands, there is a codified expectation of behavior from any and all contributors.

## Principles

We must recognize that the actions of other organizations, protocols, etc. may have undesirable side effects on the OpenMEV community (and Ethereum at large):

-   They undermine the trust that end-users and companies place in Ethereum
-   They increase the risk involved in deploying solutions based on Ethereum
-   They decrease the network value of Ethereum
-   They make OpenMEV look unprofessional to many developers, especially compared within the Ethereum/other ecosystems where major OSS projects would never behave in such a fashion

Effective immediately, OpenMEV shall codify and will support the following:

### Pro Community

-   **Pro-Community**. All OpenMEV projects will gladly accept and host integrations for Flashbots, Eden Network, and other MEV or EVM ecosystems, without consideration of the relationships, dispositions, or politics between these projects and those ecosystems, and they will provide non-discriminatory support for end-users, regardless of their disposition to or affiliation or association with other OpenMEV community members or ecosystems.

-   _pro-community_, as OpenMEV hosts integrations for Sushiswap projects *swaps* and *bentobox*, and hosts integrations for *OlympusDAO*,_LayerZero_ to date. Conflicting incentives should be considered and debated if it is possible that adding support for another project would conflict with existing integrations. However, I believe that making this behavior official will further increase trust and expand integrations, and also clearly set expectations for new projects being integrated into the OpenMEV solution sets.

### Pro Professionalism

-   **Pro-Professionalism**. Although behavior within the OpenMEV organization projects is already governed by the [OpenMEV Code of Conduct](#), I want to strengthen this code of conduct by making it clear that ad hominem and career sabotage have no place within the community. Projects in the OpenMEV organization exist only to help engineers and developers solve problems, regardless of their religion, political affiliation, race, or disposition to or affiliation or association with other OpenMEV community members or ecosystems.

- *pro-professionalism*, within OpenMEV official spaces (Github, Discourse, etc.), I have only ever seen welcoming, inclusive, and non-discriminatory behavior, without ad hominem or career sabotage. But explicitly committing to this high standard of professionalism can only help to set expectations and provide guidance for everyone as the organization continues to grow.

### The Ethereum Ecosystem

It is not necessary that open source contributors have the same views or even like each other. We must put Ethereum first, and by being pro-community and pro-professionalism, we can find a way to co-exist peacefully inside this big tent, and together, we can, in different ways and with different audiences, show the world that Ethereum is a force to reckon with.

## Social Rules

[These rules are adopted from recurse.com/manual#sec-environment](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment)

-   No well-actually's
-   No feigning surprise
-   No back-seat driving
-   No subtle -isms
-   Remember that everyone was new to Ethereum at some point.

### Why have social rules?

These rules are designed to help all of us build a pleasant, productive, and robust community. Part of being a credible neutral environment is having a baseline of interactions so that the environment does not introduce undesirable effects (social, political, drama, etc.)
