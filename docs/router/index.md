# OpenMEV Protocol Overview

🕵️ Full privacy <br /> 🛡️ Front running protection <br /> 💰 No more costly reverts <br /> 💰 Get rebated most of your
transaction cost back <br />

### How OpenMEV works

The client publishes the serialized transaction signed (via `eth_sign` or `eth_signTransaction`) by the user to our
backend using the backend repeatedly publishes the transaction, each block, to participating miners, this includes Eden
Network and Flash bots. Transaction status updates can be requested via JSON-RPC or automatically relayed to the client
with the SDK. A user can cancel an unconfirmed transaction at any time for free, and reverted transactions cost no gas

### What is OpenMEV?

OpenMEV provides a trading proxy engine that is used to protect your transactions and maximize profits on the blockchain
network. It aims to provide traders, arbitrageurs and block producers with an accessible, convenient and secure
infrastructure for transactions.

- More accessible: allow ordinary users to easily discover the trading risk and value on the blockchain network

- More convenient: enable the arbitrage traders more opportunities to increase profits at a low-cost More secure: make
  transactions on the blockchain network more secure and private.

### What public services does OpenMEV provide?

**Trading Proxy**: A private trading proxy that supports private communication between traders and block producers, can
be used for efficient transaction protection and value maximization.

**OpenMEV Explorer**: A set of tools used to improve the transparency of profit opportunities on the blockchain network
and reduce information asymmetry.

## SushiSwap

The SushiSwap integration provides a service that realizes profit by transaction batching for the purposes of arbitrage
by controlling transaction ordering.

Right now every user sends a transaction directly to the network mempool and thus give away the arbitrage,
front-running, back-running opportunities to miners(or random bots).

OpenMEV provides a credibly neutral platform that enables aggregation of transactions (batching) for the purposes of
extracting MEV profits and returning them back to the traders.

### What is `credible neutrality`?

This ethos is at the heart of OpenMEV. Part of establishing credible neutrality is having a clear and comprehensive rule
book that regulates off-chain behavior and activities. Our assumption concerning governance is that methods and
processes that work in legacy markets may not be applicable in adversarial environments such as permissionless
blockchains. With that understanding it is important not to rely solely on such systems and mechanics long term.
