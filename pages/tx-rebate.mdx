# Transaction Rebate Mechanism

## Transactions

Type0 and Type2 Transactions

Type0 transactions (Pre EIP-1559) should utilize the Price number under each
confidence level.

Type2 transactions (EIP-1559) should utilize the values for maxPriorityFeePerGas
(also known as the "tip") and maxFeePerGas .

## List of Transactions by Contract Function

*Note*: Function calls listed at 0 are not eligible at this time, however we fully plan on expanding coverage to additional functions in the future

### Transaction Pricing

**maxPrice** Highest priced transaction in the mempool

**currentBlockNumber** Block number at the time of prediction

**msSinceLastBlock** Milliseconds since the last block was mined relative to
when data was computed

**blockNumber** Block this prediction is for

**baseFeePerGas** Base fee per gas for current block in gwei. (Only type2
transactions Post EIP-1559 have this value and it's burned by the network upon
transaction success). estimatedTransactionCount Number of items we estimate will
be included in next block based on mempool snapshot

**confidence** 0-99 likelihood the next block will contain a transaction with a
gas price >= to the listed price

**Price** Price in Gwei (used for type0 transactions: Pre EIP-1559)

**maxPriorityFeePerGas** Max priority fee per gas in gwei also known as the
"tip" (used for type2 transactions: EIP-1559)

**maxFeePerGas** Max fee per gas in gwei (used for type2 transactions:
EIP-1559). Our current max fee heuristic is Base Fee \* 2 + Priority Fee. This
is to protect against a 'rapid' rise in the base fee while your transaction fee
is pending. In most cases, the actual transaction fee will approximate Base
Fee + Priority Fee.
