# Transaction Rebate Mechanism

## Transactions


Type0 and Type2 Transactions
Type0 transactions (Pre EIP-1559) should utilize the Price number under each confidence level.

Type2 transactions (EIP-1559) should utilize the values for maxPriorityFeePerGas (also known as the "tip") and maxFeePerGas .


### Transaction Pricing

**maxPrice**
Highest priced transaction in the mempool

**currentBlockNumber**
Block number at the time of prediction

**msSinceLastBlock**
Milliseconds since the last block was mined relative to when data was computed

**blockNumber**
Block this prediction is for

**baseFeePerGas**
Base fee per gas for current block in gwei. (Only type2 transactions Post EIP-1559 have this value and it's burned by the network upon transaction success).
estimatedTransactionCount
Number of items we estimate will be included in next block based on mempool snapshot

**confidence**
0-99 likelihood the next block will contain a transaction with a gas price >= to the listed price

**Price**
Price in Gwei (used for type0 transactions: Pre EIP-1559)

**maxPriorityFeePerGas**
Max priority fee per gas in gwei also known as the "tip" (used for type2 transactions: EIP-1559)

**maxFeePerGas**
Max fee per gas in gwei (used for type2 transactions: EIP-1559). Our current max fee heuristic is Base Fee * 2 + Priority Fee. This is to protect against a 'rapid' rise in the base fee while your transaction fee is pending. In most cases, the actual transaction fee will approximate Base Fee + Priority Fee.
