### What is OpenMEV?

OpenMEV provides a trading proxy engine that is used to protect your transactions and maximize profits on the blockchain network. It aims to provide traders, arbitrageurs and block producers with  an accessible, convenient and secure infrastructure for transactions.

- More accessible: allow ordinary users to easily discover the trading risk and value on the blockchain network

- More convenient: enable the arbitrage traders more opportunities to increase profits at a low cost
More secure: make transactions on the blockchain network more secure and private.

### What public services does OpenMEV provide?

**Trading Proxy**: A private trading proxy that supports private communication between traders and block producers, can be used for efficient transaction protection and value maximization.

**OpenMEV Explorer**: A set of tools used to improve the transparency of profit opportunities on the blockchain network and reduce information asymmetry.


## SushiSwap

The SushiSwap integration provides a service that realizes profit by transaction
batching for the purposes of arbitrage by controlling transaction ordering.

Right now every user sends a transaction directly to the network mempool and
thus give away the arbitrage, front-running, back-running opportunities to
miners(or random bots).

OpenMEV provides a credibly neutral platform that enables aggregation of
transactions (batching) for the purposes of extracting MEV profits and returning
them back to the traders.

### What is `credible neutrality`?

This ethos is at the heart of OpenMEV. Part of establishing credible neutrality
is having a clear and comprehensive rulebook that regulates off-chain behavior
and activities. Our assumption concerning governance is that methods and
processes that work in legacy markets may not be applicable in adversarial
environments such as permissionless blockchains. With that understanding it is
important not to rely soley on such systems and mechanics long term.
