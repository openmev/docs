## Response RPC Methods

These are methods we support for which we return static responses to ensure compliance

 ```
eth_chainId 
eth_protocolVersion 
eth_mining 
eth_hashrate 
eth_accounts 
eth_syncing 
eth_coinbase 
net_listening 
net_peerCount 
net_version 
web3_clientVersion 
 ```
 
## Supported RPC

These are all methods we expose and proxy  to our internal eth clients 
 ```
eth_blockNumber 
eth_call 
eth_estimateGas 
eth_gasPrice 
eth_getBalance 
eth_getBlockByHash 
eth_getBlockByNumber 
eth_getBlockTransactionCountByHash 
eth_getBlockTransactionCountByNumber 
eth_getCode 
eth_getStorageAt 
eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex 
eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex 
eth_getTransactionByHash 
eth_getTransactionCount 
eth_getTransactionReceipt 
eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex 
eth_getUncleByBlockNumberAndIndex 
eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash 
eth_getUncleCountByBlockNumber 
eth_sign   
eth_signTypedData   
eth_sendRawTransaction   
```
 
 
### OpenMEV Transaction
 
Same signature as `eth_sendRawTransaction` but the tx is eligible for arb and goes into our OpenMEV workflow (e.g. gas rebate).
Anything received via `eth_sendRawTransaction` just gets relayed

```
manifold_sendTransaction 
```
