## 502\. Clearing Participant Default

(A). If a Clearing Participant is in Default, Margin held with respect to such
Clearing Participant’s Member Property Accounts, and any other of such Clearing
Participant’s assets held by, pledged to or otherwise available to Commodity
Stream, LLC, may be applied by Commodity Stream, LLC to discharge the
Obligations of such Clearing Participant to Commodity Stream, LLC (including any
costs and expenses associated with the liquidation, transfer or management of
Contracts held in or for the Member Property Accounts of such Clearing

(B). If the Margin held with respect to such Clearing Participant’s Member
Property Accounts, and other of such Clearing Participant’s assets held by,
pledged to or otherwise available to Commodity Stream, LLC, including any
guarantee issued pursuant to these Rules, are insufficient to satisfy the
defaulting Clearing Participant’s Obligations to Commodity Stream, LLC after
giving effect to the application of such amounts pursuant to paragraph (a), such
defaulting Clearing Participant shall continue to be liable therefor.

(C). In closing, offsetting, transferring or otherwise resolving the Contracts
of a Clearing Participant as provided herein and in Rule 601, Commodity Stream,
LLC shall have the right:

    (i) With respect to Contracts in a Customer Account of such Commodity Stream, LLC Clearing
    Participant, to set off [x] any proceeds received by Commodity Stream, LLC from the disposition of
    such Contracts and any property or proceeds thereof deposited with or held by Commodity Stream, LLC
    as Margin for such account against [y] any amounts paid by Commodity Stream, LLC in the disposition
    of such Contracts,

    including any commissions or other losses or expenses incurred in connection therewith or
    in connection with the liquidation of Margin deposits in such Customer Account and any other
    amounts owed to Commodity Stream, LLC as a result of transactions in the Customer Account or
    otherwise lawfully chargeable against such Customer Account;

    (ii) With respect to the Contracts in any Member Property Accounts of such Clearing
    Participant, to set off (x) any proceeds received by Commodity Stream, LLC from the disposition of
    such Contracts, any property or proceeds thereof deposited with or held by Commodity Stream, LLC as
    Margin for such Member Property Accounts and any other property of the Clearing Participant within
    the possession or control of Commodity Stream, LLC other than property that has been identified by
    such Clearing Participant as required to be segregated pursuant to the CEA and CFTC Regulations,
    against (y) any amounts paid by Commodity Stream, LLC in the disposition of such Contracts,
    including any commissions or other losses or expenses incurred in connection therewith or in
    connection with the liquidation of Margin deposits in such Member Property Accounts, and any other
    Obligations of the Clearing Participant to Commodity Stream, LLC, including Obligations of the
    Clearing Participant to Commodity Stream, LLC remaining after the setoffs referred to in paragraph
    (i) above, and any Obligations arising from any other Member Property Accounts maintained by the
    Clearing Participant with Commodity Stream, LLC; and

    (iii) To defer closing or otherwise settling such trades and Contracts if, in its
    discretion, it determines that the closing out of some or all of the suspended Clearing
    Participant’s trades or Contracts would not be in the best interests of Commodity Stream, LLC or
    other Clearing Participants, taking into account the size and nature of the positions in question,
    market conditions prevailing at the time, the potential market effects of such liquidating
    transactions as might be directed by Commodity Stream, LLC, and such other circumstances as it
    deems relevant;

        (iv) Or take any action the Clearinghouse deems proper or in the best interest of the
    Clearinghouse or its Clearing Participants.

(D). For purposes of this Rule, each Default by a Network and/or Clearing
Participant will be considered a separate Default.

not limited to attempting to obtain a court order, that would interfere with the
ability of Commodity Stream, LLC to exercise its rights under the Rules and its
agreements with such Network or Clearing Participant.
